fridus, had done the like, having required
the bailiff os the Abbot to attend the exe-
cution, but the latter would not come3 and
of this he produces sufficient suit. And he
alleges, that from old time the place
where the thieves were hung was called
the “ qualmstowe,'' and he is willing to
put himself upon a jury of the two ad-
joining counties. .

. The Abbot rebuts the plea, by stating,
that if William de Criketot did make any
such execution, the sarn'e was done in
time of war3 and that if Osbert de Glan-
ville did the like, he did so in right of the
franchise of StEdmund, inasmuch as he
and Robertus de Cokeford were keepers oi
the temporalities of the abbey, which, being
vacant, was in· the King's hands. This
record affords a striking example ol the
mode in which franchises were deduced
from the Saxon era, as well as of the per·
plexity and difficulty of so deducing them.
lt also shows how firmly the Anglo-Saxon
language was retained in common use
throughout the country.
